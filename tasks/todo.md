# Task Plan

Use one section per task, named `<scope>: <task-name>`. Preserve other task sections and mark an item complete only after its completion criterion is satisfied.

## repository-wide: Make agent instructions operational

Status: Complete

- [x] Audit `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and referenced agent resources.
- [x] Resolve task artifact, loading order, active scope, approval evidence, new-spec planning, and placeholder-role decisions.
- [x] Create task tracking, lessons, and canonical terminology documents.
- [x] Align root instructions, rules, workflow, registry, and ready spec templates.
- [x] Verify frontmatter, resource references, parity, numbering, and instruction consistency.
- [x] Record the final verification result and mark this task complete.

Verification: All 32 governed Markdown files have valid required frontmatter; root instructions match apart from runtime-specific names; workflow numbering is 1–14; all required resources exist; scope and approval rules are consistent; `git diff --check` passes.

## repository-wide: Fill the data-modeling and api-contract-design skills

Status: Complete

- [x] Inspect the registry, the placeholder skills, the project templates, and the conventions used in the e-commerce schema and API work.
- [x] Write `data-modeling` (schema, migration, ER diagram, SQL tests) with references, templates, and scripts.
- [x] Write `api-contract-design` (upsert, batch, inquiry specs, checkers) with references, template, and a spec generator helper.
- [x] Register both skills as ready in `.agents/README.md`.
- [x] Test the scripts and validate the frontmatter of every new Markdown file.

Verification: both `SKILL.md` files and all seven references have valid frontmatter; `realign_tables.py`, `mutation_harness.py`, and `spec_helpers.py` were run against real inputs; `spec_helpers.py` output passes the checker's table and JSON checks. The skills have not been run against test prompts with a baseline.

## repository-wide: Write the commit-and-pr skill

Status: Complete

- [x] Ask the user which formats must be fixed, the language, the subject style, and how to treat files of other tasks.
- [x] Write `commit-and-pr` (Conventional Commits in English, fixed PR title and body, fixed chat summary, pre-send checklist) with references and `.tmpl` templates.
- [x] Write and test `scripts/preflight.py` (branch, files by area, secrets, large files, junk, `git diff --check`, optional project checkers).
- [x] Register the skill as ready in `.agents/README.md`.

Verification: `preflight.py` flagged every planted problem in a scratch repository (main branch, secret, private key, 1.2 MB file, build output, trailing whitespace) and passed a placeholder bearer token and a clean file; `--run-checks` ran 22 `check_docs.py` sub-commands, `audit_all.py` (0 findings) and `run_db_tests.sh` (ALL PASSED) on the real repository. The skill has not been run against test prompts with a baseline, and nothing was committed.
